        <p> <h3><strong>Biography:</strong></h3> Ashley Evans is a Houston native born and raised. 
            Growing up in the Houston, she cultivated a deep appreciation for the diverse culinary scene the city has to offer.
            Helping to raise her younger siblings, she got the opportunity to practice her craft as she would make meals for the family.
            Try meals from different cultures fascinated her and were always a hit.<br>
            <br>
            During her pursuit to further her knowledge and expertise in the culinary world,
            she realized there was a need that she could fill. That need was to provide the 
            home cooked meal that so many students miss out on given the diverse population of 
            the Houston area.<br> 
            <br>
            That brings us to today. She wanted to give back to the city that raised her and 
            led her down the path that she is on today. To do so, she is striving to bring
            a variety of dishes from the many cultures that make up the Houston melting pot, to
            the new University of Houston cafeteria at Sugar Land. This way even those no matter 
            how far, can have a little piece of home with them as they continue their education.
